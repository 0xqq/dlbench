Put your tools' scripts directory here and copy the benchmark scrip xxxbm.py (rename it to <your tool name>bm.py) in it.
Make sure xxxbm.py will take all these parameters pre-defined, you may ignore some of them as long as it works.
xxxbm.py will print out the running result which will be taken by benchmark.py and post to the server.
